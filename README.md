## About Me
Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸš€ Iâ€™m a career switcher on an exciting journey toward my dream job as a software developer. 
Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, Iâ€™m a dedicated full-stack developer with a passion for precision and attention to detailâ€”skills I honed as a former dental technician.
