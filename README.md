Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀 I'm an enthusiastic early-career software developer, always striving to improve and learn. My heart lies in the realm of front-end development, where my passion for precision and attention to detail, honed from my previous job as a dental technician, inspires me to create thoughtful user experiences. 
Join me on this exciting path as we collaborate and create quality work that delights users and exceeds expectations!

Stuff I'm currently involved with:
- ⚛️ Front-end web projects and mobile applications, honing my skills with React/React-native;
- 👾 Learning C++, as a videogame enthusiast I want to keep the door open for possible roles in the industry;
